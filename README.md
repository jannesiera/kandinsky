# kandinsky
An Entity Component System in javascript with Node.js

Based on the articles on http://t-machine.org written by Adam Martin (@t_machine_org) and the Artemis Entity System Framework (http://gamadu.com/artemis)

## Installation
npm install kandinsky --save

## Usage
TODO (will be written soon)

## Tests
npm test

Disclaimer: The entity system hasn't been tested AT ALL. Not even on syntax errors. There might be big and small errors breaking the system but they should be easy to fix with some actual testing ("soon").
